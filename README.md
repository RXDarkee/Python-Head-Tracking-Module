# Python-Head-Tracking-Module
Python Head Tracking Module is a real-time computer vision tool that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to track head movement through a webcam. It continuously detects the userâ€™s face, calculates the head center, and overlays a red laser-like dot that smoothly follows the movement.
